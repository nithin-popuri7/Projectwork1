## Title of the Project
Small description about the project like one below
The integration of a chatbot within a hostel booking system, aimed at streamlining the reservation process for students and improving the overall user experience.

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
Tailored Chatbot for Hostel Booking System is a project designed to integrate a chatbot that leverages advanced natural language processing techniques to understand and respond to user queries to the hostel booking system. Traditional hostel booking processes are often time-consuming and involve manual searches and extensive communication with hostel staff. This project seeks to overcome these challenges by creating an easy-to-use chatbot interface that assists students in addressing inquiries.

## Features
<!--List the features of the project as shown below-->
- Implements advance neural network method.
- A framework based application for deployment purpose.
- High scalability.
- Less time complexity.
- A specific scope of Chatbot response model, using json data format.

## Results and Impact
<!--Give the results and impact as shown below-->
our Custom Itinerary Planner are designed to thoroughly validate the system’sfunctionality across various modules, including user registration, login, itinerary creation,
personalized recommendations, and payment processing. These tests ensure that the systemmeets both functional and non-functional requirements, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience. By conducting comprehensive tests like black box testing, boundary value testing, and UI testing, we can identify potential issues early on and address them before deployment. The successful execution of these test cases guarantees that the application will be robust, secure, and capable of offering customized travel planning solutions to users, thereby enhancing overall satisfaction and performance.
